# TODO 

what happens if a user hits submit multiple times??
    multiple downloads for same url results in "raise RuntimeError("Response content longer than Content-Length")"

Need a couple of ways to detect if youtubedl will download anything
Need to make sure requests to /download/{filename} get sanitized
